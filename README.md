## Purpose
- The purpose of this project was to pull weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API to give customers options to choose vacation destinations based upon weather preferences. From there, we extracted data from the Google Maps Nearyby Places API to find potential hotel accomodations and then finally mapped the route between 4 selected destinations while also showing the nearest hotel name and current weather description.
